                                My name is Simone Kang, and I’m a computer science student at Texas A&M, class of 2025! I grew up in Los Angeles, California, and moved to College Station, Texas for school. I’m a big fan of chosen families and team affirmations! I’m an organized and efficient worker, and I have consistent and quality communication skills. I grew up as a competitive student, and through school and speech and debate I gained a work ethic and an ability to communicate well with others. I worked as a tutor in computer science, math, and speech and debate for nearly 8 years, and hope to continue this work along with gaining internship experience in the computer science industry. I hope to become a software engineer one day, as computer science is the only work that makes time fly by the way it does. I’m passionate about the good that computer science can do for the world, and at the same time comforted by the work.
