                                From an early age, I recognized the power of education and the joy of helping others learn. My journey as a tutor started at the age of 12, and I dedicated my time and skills to support students in math, computer science, and speech and debate. I continued volunteering until I was 18, and then began working as a tutor in those same subjects.  
                                I specialized in these subjects for middle school and elementary school-aged children. I’m passionate about  helping cultivate young minds, especially for subjects like math and public speaking. I’m committed to this cause, and I firmly believe that early engagement with these challenging areas is pivotal for children’s holistic development. In fact, American University wrote that “STEM education has been shown to be a predictor of future academic achievement. For example, a study by researchers at the University of California Irvine found that early math skills were the most consistently predictive measure of future academic success among kindergarten to fifth grade students”(<a id="cite" href="https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/stem-in-early-childhood-education/">American University, 2020</a>).  Those ‘aha’ moments where everything just clicks for my students is so genuinely rewarding and satisfying, and confirms my love and dedication to these children.
